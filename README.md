# Covid19ManagementSyatem_Mobile

Hello this is a mobile version of the app Covid19 Management System. This app is designed to work on accepting patient's details storing them over to the database, updating the status 
of patients and deleting them once the patient's status is discharge. There are primarily 6 packages which has many classes within them to support this Covid19 management system.
The patient's details could be listed and displayed with necessary information about them. The admin can add new patients, fill their data, update them and if any patient's status gets changed
to "Discharge" then the admin can delete that particular patient.
